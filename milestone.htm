        <h2>About </h2>
        <p>My name is Lady Malig and I am from the beautiful island of Guam. In 2018, I enlisted in the United States Air Force, which brought me here in the continental United States. After serving four years in active duty as in intelligence analyst, I decided to separate and pursue an education in information technology at Kennesaw State University. I currently work part time as a fitness instructor at a senior community and serve in the Georgia Air National guard as a training manager. On my free time you can find me at the gym, reading a book, or enjoying a show on Netflix.</p>
